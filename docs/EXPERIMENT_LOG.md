# Experiment log

This is a learning ledger, not a gallery of permanent visual answers. Screenshots
and pixel captures may be attached to a versioned experiment for comparison, but
they are not automatically promoted to timeless pass/fail truth.

## E-001-library-extraction / A1

- Parent: none
- Engine model: `ordinary-js-r1`
- Recipe schema: `1`
- Fixture manifest: `1`
- Status: passed
- Hypothesis: the accepted ordinary calculation can become a framework-free
  library without changing its numeric formulas.
- Explicit inputs and seed: existing nib profile constants, calibrated ordinary
  endpoints, and `WetInkSimulation` defaults copied from the HTML study.
- Expected at normal size: no intentional visual difference after the HTML
  harness switches to public package imports.
- Observed: Node contract tests preserve nib ladders, deterministic helpers,
  density endpoints, morphology behavior, and repeated simulation state. The
  HTML harness now consumes only public package exports; desktop and 390×844
  browser checks remained nonblank and interactive without console errors.
- Preserved evidence: the pre-extraction implementation remains in repository
  history and the HTML harness owns migration-time visual comparison.
- Next different method: keep visual changes in new recipe revisions and begin
  the next focused color-ink or Surface experiment without changing this
  extraction record.

## E-002-explicit-seed-domain / A1

- Parent: `E-001-library-extraction`
- Engine model: `ordinary-js-r2`
- Recipe schema: `1`
- Fixture manifest: `1`
- Status: passed
- Hypothesis: seed `0` must remain a distinct valid input, and no public
  material path may invent an implicit Surface seed.
- Explicit inputs and seed: PRNG seeds `0` and `1`; density cadence seed `0`
  versus missing; Surface seeds `0x13579bdf` and `0x8d60e266`.
- Expected at normal size: the existing nonzero ordinary checkpoint is
  unchanged while zero and missing seeds no longer alias.
- Observed: seed `0` now produces its own deterministic PRNG and density field;
  Canvas and direct-stroke Surface paths require an explicit non-negative seed.
- Preserved evidence: E-001 and the ordinary recipe constants remain unchanged.
- Next different method: begin a versioned color-ink or Surface experiment.
